# Routing-Algorithm-Simulator-
This project is an interactive, web-based tool for visualizing fundamental network routing algorithms. Built with HTML, JavaScript, and the D3.js library, it runs entirely in your browser, offering a step-by-step simulation of how data finds its path through a network. You can select from Dijkstra's , Bellman-Ford's , and Flooding algorithms.
